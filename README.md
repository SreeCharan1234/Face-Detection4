# Face Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **Face Detection** using OpenCV and Python. The system detects human faces in images, videos, or real-time webcam feeds. It utilizes **Haar Cascades** and **Deep Learning-based models (DNNs)** to accurately locate and highlight faces in a given frame.

## 🛠 Features
- Detect faces in images, videos, or real-time webcam feeds.
- Supports multiple face detection models.
- Option to save detected faces as separate images.
- Adjustable parameters for optimized detection.

## ⚡ Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.7+ recommended). Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Libraries
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

## 🚀 Usage
### Detect Faces in an Image
```bash
python face_detection.py --image images/sample.jpg
```

### Detect Faces in a Video
```bash
python face_detection.py --video videos/sample.mp4
```

### Real-Time Face Detection (Webcam)
```bash
python face_detection.py --webcam
```

## 🎯 Implementation Details
- **Haar Cascade Classifier:** Uses a pre-trained XML model for face detection.
- **DNN-based Detection:** Uses deep learning models for higher accuracy.
- **Multi-scale Detection:** Adjusts window size for detecting faces of various sizes.

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
- Add emotion recognition.
- Implement face recognition for identifying individuals.
- Improve detection accuracy using deep learning models (e.g., SSD, MTCNN).
